    It is used to implement an interface in a class

4.) How many interfaces can class implement?
    One

5.) Write a simple interface with one method.
    public interface InterfaceExample{
        public int weight();
    }

6.) Think of a real world application where interfaces are used. Describe it's purpose.
    Game Console interface, which most likely need to implement start, run, shutdown methods

    public interface IncorrectInterface{
        int sum(int x, int y){
