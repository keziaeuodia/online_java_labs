Answer the following questions:

1.) Why do we use generics?
    So we can define an algorithm once, independently of any specific type of data,

2.) What is type erasure?
    The replacement of the Generic type parameters at compile time by Java

3.) What is an example of a generic class that we have seen in the past?
    ArrayList<>

4.) Can an interface be generic?
    Yes

5.) What are bound and unbound generic types?
    Bound generic type is when the type parameter is limited to a certain type
    Unbound generic type is when the type parameter is not limited
