    byte - 8 bits integer
    short - unicode character
    int - 32 bits integer
    long - 64 bits integer
    float - 32 bits float
    double - 64 bits float


2.) How do you declare and initialize an int variable called "x" with the value 42.
    int x=42;

3.) What happens if you initialize a double variable with the value of a int?
    nothing, no loss of info.

4.) How do you set an int variable to the value of a double?
    the int cannot read the decimals.

5.) What are the 5 arithmetic operators?
    +, -, /, *, %

6.) What are Relational operators used for? What is the result of using a relational operator?
    To tests or defines some kind of relation between two entities
    True/False

7.) Demonstrate the use of a Relational operator.
    a == b
    a >= b
    a <= b
    a > b
    a < b
    a != b

8.) What logical operators used for? What is the result of using a logical operator?
    It is used to evaluate two booleans.
    True/False

9.) Demonstrate the use of a logical operator.
    (a > 0) && (b > 0)
    (a > 0) || (b > 0)
    (a > 0) & (b > 0)
    (a > 0) | (b > 0)
    (a > 0) ^ (b > 0)
    !(a > 0) & (b > 0)

10.) How can you use the shorthand addition operator to add 10 to a variable "x"?
    x += 10

11.) What data type is a String?
    Object type

12.) Are string mutable?
    No

13.) How do you concatenate Strings?
    Using +

14.) Can you cast and int to a String or a String to an int? Why or why not?


15.) What is an array?
    An array is a collection of variables of the same type, referred to by a common name

16.) What is the first index of an array?
    0

17.) Can you change the size of an array once it has been declared and initialized?
    No

18.) How do you print the 5th element in an array "exampleArray"?
    exampleArray[5];

19.) What are the two ways you can declare and initialize an array? Demonstrate both.
    int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};

    or

    int[] array = new int[10];
    int x = array[0];

20.) How do you iterate through a multidimensional array?
    Using nested for loops

21.) What is the for-each loop used for?
    For-each loop is used to iterate over a collection of variables, such as arrays
