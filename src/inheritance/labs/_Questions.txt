Answer the following questions:

1.) What is inheritance?
    A program hierarchy where the subclass inherits the variables and methods that the parentclass/superclass has

2.) Why do we use inheritance?
    Because it allows us to reuse or override the codes in the parent class, so the code doesn't need to be rewritten over and over again

3.) Provide a real world example where you think inheritance would be implemented.
    Animals - Mammals - Marine Mammals - Dolphins

4.) How does a class inherit another class?
    By extending the superclass

5.) How many levels can a hierarchy extend?
    Unlimited

6.) What is the "super" keyword used for?
    To call the superclass

7.) When a subclass object is created, in what order do the constructors execute?
    Calling the superclass constructor super();

8.) What is method overwriting?
    Accessing a method in subclass that has the same return type and signature as a method in the superclass

9.) How can method overwriting be beneficial?
    It supports polymorphism, where we can still uses all the other methods as is, but we can override just one(or more) method that doesn't behave like the one in the superclass
